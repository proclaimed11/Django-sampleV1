create a vscode workspace for your project(optional)
    ~ File > Save Workspace as...

create a requirements.txt file 
    ~ inside place you installation requirements(optional)

create an src folder where your main files will be placed (you can name this file however)

its a proper practice to create a virtual env for your project so that the global dependencies may not conflict 
with the project dependencies/libraries

    ~ python -m venv virtual_env(folder name)

enter virtual env with command 
    ~ .\virtual_env(folder name)\Scripts\Activate.ps1

install everything installed inside your requirements.txt
    ~ pip install -r requirements.txt

its a good practice to also update your pip often (optional)
    ~ pip install pip --upgrade

check if django is installed
-Go to the src(main folder)
    ~ cd src

-Run the command
    ~ django-admin  (you should get a list of command that can be run by this admin)

Now we create our project
    -while still inside the src 
    ~django-admin startproject  projectname . (the period at the end is important to emphasize that the project should be created in the current directory)


start the project by running in the same src directory
    ~ python manage.py runserver

===========================ADDING NEW APPS===================================================================

After you have created a project you can create an app inside your project via the command
    ~ python manage.py startapp app_name


NB: The django-admin startproject  projectname . created a base project , but the apps are the 
variety of services/micro-services found inside your project 
 
 Eg: Base project(Loans and Savings app)
     service/app- finances

After adding creating an app you should add that app at the settings.py of the base project 
inside the INSTALLED_APPS

    ~INSTALLED_APPS=[
        ....other apps

       'app name' 
    ]

================================CREATING MODELS=========================================================

After you create or update any models inside your apps you should run the command
   ~ python manage.py makemigrations
   
   then propagate the changes to the db by:-

   ~python manage.py migrate 


   ========================DEPLOYMENT=======================================
